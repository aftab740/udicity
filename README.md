# Loan Dataset Analysis - Summary of Main Findings
This repository contains an analysis of a loan dataset obtained from the Prosper marketplace. The aim of this analysis was to gain insights into the loan data, explore relationships between variables, and identify key factors that influence loan outcomes and performance.

# Data Exploration
The initial step involved exploring the dataset's variables and their distributions. Univariate analysis was conducted to understand the characteristics of individual variables and identify any outliers or unusual patterns.

# Bivariate Analysis
The next step was to investigate relationships between pairs of variables to uncover correlations and associations. Visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts were used to examine these relationships. Variables such as credit grade, loan status, loan amount, income range, occupation, and more were analyzed.

# Multivariate Analysis
To gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, multivariate analysis was performed by creating plots involving three or more variables. This allowed for the exploration of relationships and patterns from different perspectives. Scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices were utilized to visualize these relationships.

# Summary of Findings
The analysis revealed several key findings. It was observed that loan status and credit grade were closely related, with higher default rates and past-due counts for lower credit grades. Loan amounts varied across different loan statuses, with completed loans having a wider range and canceled loans showing lower loan amounts. The relationship between ProsperScore and income range indicated that higher ProsperScores were associated with higher income ranges. Additionally, positive correlations were found between revolving credit balance and LP customer payments, while no correlation was observed between percent funded and investors.

The steps taken during the data exploration allowed for the uncovering of insights into the loan dataset and understanding of the relationships between variables. Various visualization techniques were used to present the findings in a clear and interpretable manner. These findings can be valuable for lenders, financial institutions, and researchers in assessing risks, making informed decisions, and improving lending practices.
